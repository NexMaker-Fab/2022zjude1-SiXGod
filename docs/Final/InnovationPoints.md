# Points of Innovation

**Design concept: A smart sound music toy that inspires empathy between children and plants**

**Fun + education + popular science = Our design**

### 1 Innovation Point 1: Multimodal sensory interaction

· By converting plant electrical signals into audio messages, users can get richer sensory stimulation when touching plants.

· From a single visual experience to auditory and tactile level.

### 2 Innovation 2: The development of natural empathy

· Studies have shown that sensing expressive biological signals can promote emotional understanding and connection with others, and listening to heartbeats is well suited as an empathic intervention.

· White noise is used to show the "home" sounds of plants, anthropomorphizing plants and making empathy more natural.
