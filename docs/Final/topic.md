# The Goal of Design

For SDGS, our design goals are:
- 4-Quality Education  

The design aims to provide children with better educational toys related to humanity, psychology and empathy, to help achieve a more comprehensive natural education for children, and to cultivate children's sound psychology.

- 15-Life on Land

Plants are one of the most important components of land life. Teaching a reverence for nature and a respect for life from an early age could help preserve life on land at a much lower level.
