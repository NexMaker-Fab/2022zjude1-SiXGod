### 1 Nature Education Design Products

Nature education refers to the education which is practiced in nature and advocates the harmonious relationship between man and nature. At present, the development mode of natural education in China is mainly parent-child experience, which has some problems such as dabbleness, homogenization and serious formalization, and most of them are one-time sightseeing and leisure consumption activities. Shallow nature experience projects can no longer meet the needs of children and parents, nor can they achieve the role of nature education.

### 2 Competing goods: Nature Education for Children - Sound

#### 2.1 Light feedback and sound feedback
- **Smart Touch Music Flower Pot: 3 in 1 Smart flower pot - plant piano, night light, Bluetooth speaker**

</div>

**Design Description:**

· Plant Music piano - Makes piano sounds by touching the leaves or stems of real plants

· Rainbow Night light - seven colors changing regularly/consistently soft white light

· Bluetooth speakers -- Connect to Bluetooth devices such as mobile phones to play personalized music

**Opportunities**

The electrode needle at the bottom of the pot can only reflect the musical feedback of a single plant. As long as the plant is touched, there is a piano sound, a preset piano melody, regardless of the location of the touch.  
  
    



#### 2.2 The mapping between physical quantities measured from plants and musical notes

The user's hand touch will increase the plant electrical signal, resulting in melody pitch changes.

- **Nature's Song with PLANTChoir**
**Design Description:**  

· It uses plants as the musical interface to create the harmonic effect of a variety of plants.

· When the electrodes are attached to the plant, the two electrodes detect slight electrical changes in the plant, which are mapped as a wave, and map to the pitch information of a particular instrument, the texture of the sound.

· Users can select specific instruments, chord scales and speeds on the app. The program will automatically generate tunes based on changes in the electrodes connected to the two ends of the plant, and play the environmental music transformed by the plant signals.

- **Music of the Plants**
**Design Description:**  
It uses plants as music interface, converts the perceived electromagnetic signals of plants into music harmony, and is compatible with indoor and outdoor multi-scene use.

When people touch with different gestures, the signal waves increase, causing the pitch of the tune to change.

- **PlantWave**
**Design Description:**

Listen to the music of plants and immerse yourself in nature with PlantWave.

· The user can select the electrode patch/alligator clip based on the plant form. The two electrodes detect slight electrical changes in the plant, which are depicted as a wave and mapped to the pitch information and sound texture of the specific instrument.

· The product can be connected to the app/professional music device to obtain more instruments and custom music options.

· Automatically generate tunes and play music based on changes in the electrodes connecting the two ends of the plant.

**Opportunities**

· The shape of the product and the way of interaction are almost the same.

· How can the interaction form become more natural and harmonious, and more in line with the operation habits of the group of children?

· How to increase the sense of interaction between people and plants?
For example, how to direct the needle into the plant/how to direct the touch of the leaf? Which plants?

· Most of the existing products output "the sound of a certain plant" by means of "selecting a musical instrument and artificially tuning", focusing on MIDI music editing and lacking the cognitive process of plants and nature.

· Can it be visualized?
