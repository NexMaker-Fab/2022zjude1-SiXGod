# Design Scheme

### 1 Design Scheme

Natural Song (tentative name) is a children's music experience product based on plant interaction. It is designed for children users, so that children can feel the sounds from the "hometown" of plants at home. By collecting the capacitance value of the plant, the device can detect when the plant is being petted and play the guided voice and corresponding nature music, allowing children to develop empathy for nature while having fun.
